- Create shoe-details component 
  * figure out the best approach to toggle showing and hiding shoe details component (Cdk, custom, etc)
  * remove 'add to cart' button from shoe item of home screen and place into shoe details component
  * add shoe size selection to shoe details component

- LoadCartAction
 * LoadCartAction is probably not needed and should probably be removed
 * Maybe update cart to contain an id reference to shoes in the shoeState
